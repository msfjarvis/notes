# Android App Development

This is probably just going to be an index of my Android related notes so they're easier to locate.

- [[[r8-inlining-bugs]]]: R8's full mode fails on some specific inputs, here's how to get a fixed version.
- [[[searchview-and-toolbar]]]: Android's [SearchView](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/appcompat/widget/SearchView) is a glorious pain in the ass.
- [[[kotlin-experimental-apis]]]: Kotlin has powerful features for marking APIs as experimental and letting users know of that experimental status.
