# Potential bugs with R8's full mode

It appears that some code in the latest revision of Google's R8 optimizer is causing it to try and inline things it shouldn't, and thus fail.

Exhibit 1 from [compose-lobsters](https://msfjarvis.dev/g/compose-lobsters)

```
R8: com.android.tools.r8.errors.e: FORCE inlining on non-inlinable: void dev.msfjarvis.lobsters.data.source.PostsDatabase.constructor$androidx$room$RoomDatabase()
```

Speciment 2 from wireguard-android

```
R8: FORCE inlining on non-inlinable: void androidx.fragment.app.FragmentManagerImpl.constructor$androidx$fragment$app$FragmentManager()
```

This can be fixed by turning off R8's full mode by setting `android.enableR8.fullMode=false` in `gradle.properties`.
